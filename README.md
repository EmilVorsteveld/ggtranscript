The goal of `ggtranscript` is to …

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `ggtranscript` from
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) using the following code:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("ggtranscript")
```

And the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/dzhang32/ggtranscript) with:

``` r
BiocManager::install("dzhang32/ggtranscript")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library("ggtranscript")
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub!

## Citation

Below is the citation output from using `citation('ggtranscript')` in R.
Please run this yourself to check for any updates on how to cite
**ggtranscript**.

``` r
print(citation('ggtranscript'), bibtex = TRUE)
#> 
#> To cite package 'ggtranscript' in publications use:
#> 
#>   David Zhang (2021). ggtranscript: What the Package Does (One Line,
#>   Title Case). R package version 0.99.0.
#>   https://github.com/dzhang32/ggtranscript
#> 
#> A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is
#> 
#>   @Manual{,
#>     title = {ggtranscript: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)},
#>     author = {David Zhang},
#>     year = {2021},
#>     note = {R package version 0.99.0},
#>     url = {https://github.com/dzhang32/ggtranscript},
#>   }
```

Please note that the `ggtranscript` was only made possible thanks to
many other R and bioinformatics software authors, which are cited either
in the vignettes and/or the paper(s) describing this package.
